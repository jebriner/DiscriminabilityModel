Normalized Kyle's interference filter spectra to 1. This file includes the lab's full set of narrow-band filters, 300-700 nm.

There's a weird blip around 550 nm that looks like a curve that hasn't been normalized, but that's just part of the curve for 300 nm. Apparently the 300 nm filter spectra extends into the longer wavelengths. Since the signal for the 300 nm filter is normally very faint and I just threw it into a megaphone by normalizing it relative to the brightest filter, the blip is probably just magnified noise.
